**Local mutational diversity drives intratumoral immune heterogeneity in non-small cell lung cancer**   
Extracting matrix and phenotype information needs to be manually downloaded from GEO for ssGSEA analysis, only the processed matrix and gene set are used; after normalizing the score results,
heat map drawing.
